## Creational
>* Factory
    - Simple Factory
    - Factory
    - Abstract Factory
>* Builder

## Structural
>* Decorator
>* Composite
>* Bridge  
    - Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. 
## Behavioral
>* Strategy  
    - Program to an interface, not an implementation  
    - Favor object aggregation over class inheritance  
    - Seperation of Concerns(SOC)
>* Chain of responsibility
>* Mediator
